Of course all of this information is available elsewhere, but I felt like it would be somewhat useful to centralize a set of comparisons here. At a minimum, researching this and typing it all of out for myself will help me remember these details by virtue of muscle memory. This exercise certainly helped solidify my current understanding as well as revealed big holes in it.
I have no idea whether this will be actually useful to anyone else... and it's still a work in progress and most certainly not comprehensive. I also thought it was kind of interesting to see the similarities and differences of tools there are for them.

<a name="csharp-repl">¹</a> This assumes the Mono platform; for the .NET platform, there is a REPL available outside Visual Studio [here](http://scriptcs.net/).  
<a name="fsharp-repl">²</a> This assumes the Mono platform; for the .NET platform, the REPL is started by running `fsi.exe`.  
<a name="haskell-compiler">³</a> This assumes, of course, that you are using GHC; there are other compilers. See [this page](https://wiki.haskell.org/Implementations) for a detailed list.  
<a name="utop">⁴</a> Julia can also be run in a notebook interface through a browser. See [this article](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) for details on installation.  
<a name="utop">⁵</a> UTop offers a _much_ better user experience than the bultin REPL.  
<a name="ocamlfind">⁶</a> OASIS relies on `ocamlfind` for name resolution of dependencies.  
<a name="ocamlbuild">⁷</a> OASIS generates various files for configuring the build and relies on `ocamlbuild` for building the project. See the [documentation](http://ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/setting_up_with_oasis.html#Goingfurther) for details.  
<a name="prolog">⁸</a> See [here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Prolog_implementations) for a fairly comprehensive comparison of implementations.  
<a name="virtualenv">⁹</a> [`virtualenv`](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/) manages multiple Python environments such that each project has its own interpreter and installed packages.  
<a name="psci">¹⁰</a> `psci` does not work outside the context of a project. If you want somewhat of a standalone REPL, create a new PureScript project in your home directory using Pulp; `pulp psci` will then have available whatever libraries are installed to that project.   
<a name="rusti">¹¹</a> As of this writing, the latest version of `rusti` only works with the nightly build of Rust from 2016/08/01.
